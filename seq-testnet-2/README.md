## Run the Sequencer

> **NOTE**: the guides assume some knowledge around running Cosmos SDK based nodes. It is highly recommended to familiarise yourself with this type of node operation before running a Fuel Sequencer node.

These are the main options for running the Sequencer:

- [Run a Sequencer Full Node (non-Validator)](./RUN_NODE.md)
- [Run a Sequencer Validator, which requires you to run a Sidecar and an Ethereum node as well](./RUN_VALIDATOR.md).

> **IMPORTANT**: If you are running a validator in a sentry node architecture, you should follow the validator guide when setting up the sentry nodes as well. This is especially because your sentry nodes should be connected to a Sidecar as well. Otherwise, your validator's performance might suffer.

## Monitoring

Refer to the [monitoring guide](./MONITORING.md) for steps on how to monitor your setup.
